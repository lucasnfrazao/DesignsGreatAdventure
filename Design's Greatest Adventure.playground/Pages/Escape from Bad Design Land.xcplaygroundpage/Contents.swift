### Escape from Bad Design Land
 
 We've covered the basics of interface design and helped Lucas' grandma to enter the **Great World of Design**. Now, let's take a next step to talk about some other important aspects of UI Design.

 According to a study by the **Nielsen Norman Group**, a bad designed interface can have serious impacts on how your project is received. For example, it could lose up to 40% of users that wouldn't be returning because of a negative experience.

 Developing a solid experience for everyone can be big challenge and there are a lot of tasks we have to check off in order to reach the best possible results.

 There are **three aspects** that will make a huge difference in how our app is perceived:

 - Grids
 - Typography
 - Colors

 Your objetive here is to help Lucas grandma escape from the **Bad Design Land!**. Based on the three aspects presented earlier, your design decisions you determine rather or not she will be able to reach the **Best Practices Mountain**.

 Tap **Run My Code** when you're ready!
